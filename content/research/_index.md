_If any of the research themes described below are of interest to you and you would like to collaborate with me, please contact me at trisha.gopalakrishna@ouce.ox.ac.uk_

My research includes multiple themes of applied and collaborative work, intending to be useful to a wide range of audiences ranging from policy makers at multiple levels of governance to on-the-ground practitioners. 

__Current Research__

For my doctoral research, I am researching the potential of reforestation to mitigate climate change and provide biodiversity and water services, in India. I have proposed to answer three main questions 1) where is refoestation potential in India, without compromising food security and biodiversity, 2) what are the trade-offs and synergies between carbon sequestration, water supply and habitat for biodiversity from reforestation activities and 3) what are the socio-political challenges for implementation of reforestation schemes and what are the opportunities, despite these challenges. 

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, I am revising my proposed questions as I was supposed to completed extensive fieldwork. Hence, questions 2 & 3 will be modified.
