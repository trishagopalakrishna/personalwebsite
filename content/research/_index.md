If any of the research themes described below are of interest to you and you would like to collaborate with me, please contact me at __trisha.gopalakrishna@ouce.ox.ac.uk__

My research includes multiple themes of applied and collaborative work, intending to be useful to a wide range of audiences ranging from policy makers at multiple levels of governance to on-the-ground practitioners. 

For my doctoral research, I aim to inform restoration of tropical forest systems, while maintaining biodiversity, water services and opportunities for climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience. I am interested in restoration that requires land use change (non-forest to forest cover at various thresholds of tree cover) and within degraded forest systems.

__1.Climate change mitigation__

I am interested in understanding the potential and opportunities available for climate change mitigation on restoration efforts, that include land use change from non-forest to forest  (at different thresholds of tree cover) and within degraded forest systems. 

My previous research at the Nature Conservancy, has widely been used at multiple policy arenas that includes preparation and implementation of various countries' [Nationally Determined Contributions](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs), as part of the the [UNFCC COP 15 (Paris Agreement)](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings#:a0659cbd-3b30-4c05-a4f9-268f16e5dd6b). I primarily focused on determination of the climate change mitigation potential on restoration requiring land use change, specifically via natural regeneration globally, in the States and in India. 
Within degraded forest systems, I worked on estimating climate change mitigation potential in selectively logged tropical forest systems, with emphasis on assessment and limitation of damage during the various harvesting operations, using the Reduced Impact Logging for Carbon protocol. 

__2.Biodiversity__

I am interested in understanding the potential of biodiverse tropical forest systems in supporting a variety of services that include adaptation and resilience to future climate change conditions and economic services such as timber harvest. 

My research as a Masterâ€™s student included estimation of the composition, diversity and structure of tropical forests under anthropogenic pressure of selective logging and bushmeat hunting, in Central Africa. I have also completed research on the estimation of habitats of endemic birds of the Western Ghats (using species distribution modeling), needed for IUCN red listing purposes and explored cryptic species of two endemic frog genera of the Western Ghats. 

__3.Water related services__

An area of research that I am yet to delve into, I am broadly interested in collaborative research linking water related services and restoration. Please do reach out to me to collaborate!
