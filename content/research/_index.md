_If any of the research themes described below are of interest to you and you would like to collaborate with me, please contact me at trisha.gopalakrishna@ouce.ox.ac.uk_

My research includes multiple themes of applied and collaborative work, intending to be useful to a wide range of audiences ranging from policy makers at multiple levels of governance to on-the-ground practitioners. 

__Current Research__

For my doctoral research, I aim to inform restoration of tropical forest systems, while maintaining biodiversity, water services and opportunities for climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience. I am interested in restoration that requires land use change (non-forest to forest cover at various thresholds of tree cover) and within degraded forest systems.

  _1. Tradeoffs and synergies ecosystem services_
  
I am broadly interested in determining the climate change mitigation, biodiversity and water related services received on a variety of restoration activities, focusing largely on the wins and losses between these services, associated with each chosen restoration activity. 

  _2.  Changes in above services under future climate change scenarios_
  
I am interested in understanding the changes in above ecosystem services under future climate change scenarios, to inform restoration efforts leading to adaptive and resilient forest systems that continue to provide services that we depend on. 

__Previous Research__

_1.Climate change mitigation_

My previous research at the Nature Conservancy primarily focused on [Natural Climate Solutions](https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-insights/perspectives/natural-climate-solutions/). I primarily focused on quantifying the climate change mitigation potential from restoration requiring land use change, (via natural regeneration) globally, in the States and in India. Within degraded forest systems, I worked on estimating climate change mitigation potential in selectively logged tropical forests, with emphasis on assessment and limitation of damage during the various harvesting operations, using the Reduced Impact Logging for Carbon protocol.


_2.Biodiversity_

My previous research as a Masterâ€™s student included estimation of the composition, diversity and structure of tropical forests under anthropogenic pressures of selective logging and bushmeat hunting, in Central Africa. I also completed research on the determining habitats of endemic birds of the Western Ghats (using species distribution modeling), needed for IUCN red listing purposes and explored cryptic species of two endemic frog genera of the Western Ghats.
