I am an ecologist interested in understanding the tradeoffs and synergies between ecosystem services on restoration of tropical forest systems. 

My overall goal is to develop the science for prioritization of successful and scalable restoration tools and techniques in tropical forest systems, that will provide multiple ecosystem services, under future climate change scenarios. I primarily use remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical analysis in my research. 

I am currently a Probationer Research Student (PRS) in the [DPhil Geography and Environment program at the University of Oxford](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/), advised by [Dr. Yadvinder Malhi](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/ymalhi.html).  I am also the Oxford-Indira Gandhi 2019 Scholar at the [Oxford India Center for Sustainable Development](https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-india-centre/), Somerville College, University of Oxford. 

I am a Master of Environmental Management (MEM) graduate- Ecosystem Science and Conservation concentration and earned the GIS certificate from the [Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University](https://nicholas.duke.edu/), in 2016. I was part of [Dr. John Poulsen's tropical ecology lab](https://www.tropicalecology.us/), co-advised by Dr. Poulsen and [Dr. Dean Urban](https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/urban).
