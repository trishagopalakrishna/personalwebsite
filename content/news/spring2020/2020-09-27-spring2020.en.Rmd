I matriculated at Somerville College making me a student of Oxford officially. The first term whizzed by very quickly as I got involved in the university life and department classes.

As the COVID-19 pandemic related lockdowns started being imposed in the UK, I successfully transfered status from a Probationer Research Student to a DPhil candidate, assessed by [_Professor Natalie Seddon_](https://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-nathalie-seddon) and [_Dr. David Bauman_].
