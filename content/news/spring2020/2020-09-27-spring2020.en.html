<p>I matriculated at Somerville College making me a student of Oxford officially. The first term whizzed by very quickly as I got involved in the university life and department classes.</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic related lockdowns started being imposed in the UK, I successfully transfered status from a Probationer Research Student to a DPhil candidate, assessed by <a href="https://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-nathalie-seddon"><em>Professor Natalie Seddon</em></a> and [<em>Dr.Â David Bauman</em>].</p>
