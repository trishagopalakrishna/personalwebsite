+ I returned to pursue my 2nd year of Master's at Duke after an eventful summer at Ipassa Research Station, Ivindo National Park, Gabon.


+ I was awarded the IDEAWILD Equipment Grant for my fieldwork over the summer. Woot!

+ I have been nominated as an Associate Member to the Sigma- Xi society in recognition of my potential as an outstanding career researcher. This will be a great opportunity and I look forward to it!
