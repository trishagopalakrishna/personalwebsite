I have had to rethink my proposed DPhil research questions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as I was supposed to carry out fieldwork in India. As a consequence, I am currently reviewing my proposal.However, I have made strides with the analyses of my first dissertation chapter, which used GIS, remote sensing and statistical analyses. 

I presented an academic poster at the [_NbS Digital Dialogues 2020_](https://www.naturebasedsolutionsoxford.org/nbs-digital-dialogues/), a virtual conference hosted by the Nature based Solutions Initiative, University of Oxford, about the importance of India's semi-arid savannahs.
