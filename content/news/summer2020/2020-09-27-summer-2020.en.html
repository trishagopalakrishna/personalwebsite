<p>I have had to rethink my proposed DPhil research questions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as I was supposed to carry out fieldwork in India. As a consequence, I am currently reviewing my proposal.However, I have made strides with the analyses of my first dissertation chapter, which used GIS, remote sensing and statistical analyses.</p>
<p>I presented an academic poster at the <a href="https://www.naturebasedsolutionsoxford.org/nbs-digital-dialogues/"><em>NbS Digital Dialogues 2020</em></a>, a virtual conference hosted by the Nature based Solutions Initiative, University of Oxford, about the importance of Indiaâ€™s semi-arid savannahs.</p>
