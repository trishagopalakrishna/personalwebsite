+ I will be moving to Arlington, VA to start a science internship with the Center for Sustanability Science, The Nature Conservancy! I will be involved in two projects- understanding knowledge diffusion/sharing within and beyond TNC being the first and estimating aboveground live grassland biomass in the southern Andean mountains of Peru.

+ I graduated with a Master of Environmental Management, Ecosystem Science and Conservation concentration! I also managed to earn the GIS certificate. I am so happy that I went to Duke and graduated!
